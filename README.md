I performed these tests with 6 epochs instead of 12 epochs due to the lack of GPU

1.  (25 points) a 3x3 convolution layer with 4 convolutions followed by a softmax
    Test Accuracy: 0.9859
    Test Loss: 0.0442811590289

2.  (25 points) a 3x3 convolution with 32 convolutions followed by a softmax
    Test accuracy: 0.9894
    Test loss: 0.0325783970155

3.  (25 points) a 3x3 convolution layer with 32 convolutions followed by a 2x2 max pool followedby softmax
    Test accuracy: 0.99
    Test loss: 0.0298664326341
